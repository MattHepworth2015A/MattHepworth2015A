- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattHepworth2015A / Supertiny808
- 👀 I’m interested in ... The handy utilities available on Github, Industrial Cyber Security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Not much, spending spare time building e-bike mopeds, considering Arduino integration to be more Two-wheel Tesla -esque
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... In future, creating a fully UK made e-bike - This will require software from the User interface to the sine wave generator for the motor, regen control, Mobile and 5G integration.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email supertiny@hotmail.co.uk
